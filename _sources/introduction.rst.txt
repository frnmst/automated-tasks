Introduction
============

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I have written and/or adapted.
Releasing them to the public is a way to improve their quality as well as to
simplify their deployment.

Automated tasks run when certain events happen: for example when a flash drive
is connected to the system some documents get backed up automatically to it.
